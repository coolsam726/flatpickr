### Improvements and Fixes:

1. Dark mode is now enabled on the fly for the FilamentPHP admin panel.
2. The package can now be used in standalone forms outside the filament admin panel. Closes #1, #2, #6, #23
3. Almost all of Flatpickr's native configuration is now supported out of the box through a fluent interface. Closes #10, #11, #24
4. Alpine.js component is now loading lazily using async-alpine

### Breaking Changes

1. Assets have to be published by running `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-flatpickr-assets` in order to be registered
2. The `rangePicker` and `multiplePicker` methods have been renamed to `range` and `multiple` respectively.
3. Due to the use of enums, the package now only supports **PHP >= 8.1**
